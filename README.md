# 📁 Electronics & Robotics Datasheets

This is my **personal collection** of datasheets for electronics and robotics components.  
I use this repository to organize the documents I often need for hardware design, embedded development, and robotics projects.

Although it's created for my own reference, I've made it **public** so that students, makers, and engineers can benefit too. Feel free to explore, download, or contribute.

## 📂 What’s Inside?

Datasheets are organized into categories like:

- 🧠 Microcontrollers (e.g., STM32, ATmega, ESP32)
- 📡 Modules (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GSM)
- 🔋 Power ICs (LDOs, regulators, battery chargers)
- 🎛️ Sensors (temperature, pressure, gas, IMU, etc.)
- 📺 Displays (OLED, TFT, LCD)
- 🔧 Passive Components (resistors, capacitors, inductors)
- 🌀 Actuators (motors, servos, drivers)
- ⚡ Connectors, switches, and more

## 🔎 Why I Created This

- ✅ Quick access to component datasheets while working on embedded or robotics projects
- ✅ Personal documentation for future reference
- ✅ Helping others in the community by sharing useful technical documents

## 📘 Notes

- Most files are in PDF format.
- I try to include the **original manufacturer datasheet** whenever possible.
- Folders may be updated as I use new components in my projects.
